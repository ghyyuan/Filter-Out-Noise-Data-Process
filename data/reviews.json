Back in March, I ordered a crib converter to convert my child's crib to a toddler bed. I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I know for sure, I will NEVER shop there again though.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people.

The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa\u2019s husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

It did not get complete because some of the wood did not match our floor (100% understandable!) We were told they would be back this morning to complete the work.  My husband takes the morning off of work and we have a photographer scheduled at 1pm to take photos to put our house on the market.  The morning passes and we never hear from anyone.  Finally my husband messages the worker directly and he said that they erew coming this afternoon instead.  Someone from James Carpets was supposed to reach out to us.  My husband has to take the full day off work and now we need to wait to put our house on the market.  Here's where the problem happened:\n\nI call the store to see what happened.  When I explain the situation to the lady who answered her reply was \"well, those phones fail us all the time dont they?  Is there anything else you need?\" I asked for a Manager to call me. Someone called about an hour later and his response was almost unbelievable.  He explained that they had to change the wood. Great, but the issue here is that no one communicated with us that there would be a delay.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

We were told our money would not be returned (even though no contract was signed) and after stating we were contacting the Attorney General was met with \"threaten me to try to ruin my life or livelihood, as unjust, wrong, or vile as I think that is. \"\n\nI have never been the person to leave a bad review or bad mouth someone. I won't even send back my food in restaurants if it's wrong, but this has been a terrible experience I would never wish this upon anyone. I had read other bad reviews, but I never trust just one person's experience... maybe now I will.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890c05c4ee01179:0xbfce2030e2e917e2"}

While getting dressed she spent more time taking pictures of the wedding rings than of the girls and the bride. After the ceremony she kept asking what kind of poses we wanted to do instead of being creative and telling us. During the reception she walked around smoking, at the bar, fixing a to go plate which were plenty of real plates because we were at a nice restaurant (she just chose to grab a to go plate because she wanted food to go, so you a lie!) and eating off the kids buffet (which was for children 12 and under only, you wrote it yourself). She didn't even get any pictures of the bride and father dance, none of the wedding favor's table, or food table.  All those pictures came from family who took their own pictures and sent it to the bride. The bride was very upset because of the money she spent to capture her one and only wedding day and to be told that most of the pictures were destroyed only after she kept hassling the photographer for months. Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.  I would not lie about any of this...God knows everything i have written is all true! I guess she's picking how great she is with different brides because she was not great at all.

We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d. Lol!\n\nWe are a DHL authorized shipping center, and we do accept pre-labeled DHL shipments at our location. We just don\u2019t have enough demand for the service to print labels from our account."}, "gmap_id": "0x886211946d170b1f:0x88ce374972b76f07"}

The pediatric section is fine (although with Dr. Roy's leaving, I'm not sure what direction this may take), the URGENT Care section is pretty standard, and the receptionists aren't particularly friendly, but they aren't particularly snippy or abrupt either. If not for my PCP, I would give SARHA a 4. It's pretty standard and effective as far as Health Organizations.\nHowever, Dr. Walters has been my PCP now for about a year. I have seen him twice and talked with him on the phone about 3 times. I haven't had a PCP in years. Due to circumstances, I have a cardiologist that I regularly follow up with and I started seeing an OB about 6 years ago when I was first pregnant. My OB has mainly acted in the place of a PCP for me.\nHowever, about a year ago, I required major open heart surgery. After this, many specialists were insistent that I acquire a PCP, and Dr. \"Jack\" Walters was the only one close to my area, so I followed through with that. I wish I had read reviews of him beforehand.\nHe is not only callous, but altogether pretty much useless. During my first visit to him (literally 2 weeks after being discharged from UAB, where I'd stayed for over a month) he told me there was nothing he could do for my feelings of sluggishness, tiredness, or depressive issues. If I wanted to feel better: diet and exercise. After my surgery, I developed an infection, so I called to try to schedule an appointment with him to have this taken care of locally - he refused. I also developed extreme dehydration which triggered an AFib, and guess what? He wouldn't treat me. He sent me back to a UAB specialist. Then when I developed a UTI.... you guessed it - back to UAB. The only time he didn't refuse to treat me was when I developed flu-like symptoms and saw him in URGENT care. He prescribed me some strong medication like tamaflu and sent me home.\nThe only thing he seemed useful for was to keep my prescriptions current. I take 40mg of Vibryd for depression and anxiety, and have for nearly 4 years. However, he cut that dose in half for me and prescribed 20 mg. Obviously, I thought this was a mistake so I didn't address it right away and I would take two 20mg to stay on my current 40mg dose, which was initially given to me by my OB, recommended by a therapist.\nWhen I called yesterday to ask for a refill, the secretary informed me that Dr. Walters would refuse to prescribe me any medication unless he saw me in clinic again, even though I saw him in September, about 7 months ago. Maybe I'm the only one who thought that an annual meant once a year, but okay. So, like I said: pretty much useless in my opinion.\nI'm not happy with the treatment, or lack of treatment, I've received from Dr. Walters, and I'm not happy about my medication situation. I would not recommend him to anyone, especially if you have a specialist or an OB that you have a fairly good working relationship with.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ded0fa015695d:0xbcb946f9bb2631cd"}

The store looks great and it's great to have a good hardware store so close. Also, the personnel were knowledgeable which usually is why I prefer stores like this over Big box retailers.\n\nSo I've had a day to consider my experience at this store. I was excited to have a reason to go to the new Ace store not too far from me. It didn't go well. And for perspective, I almost never strongly complain. But, to start, I'm exceptionally busy and need a place that is easy for transactions and returns. So, being busy, I went to the shed and found out I didn't have the key for the pad lock. I ran to Ace and picked up a small bolt cutter. Coming home, I tried twice on the lock and realized it was too small.\n\nReturning to the store, I tried to return the item within 30 minutes of purchase (with receipt) to buy a large Bolt cutter. This is when I found out about the 'no return' for used items policy. OK, I can accept that. I won't be able to shop there. But I accept that. The problem? From my perspective, the owner was rude. 'No, we won't take that back. It's used' he said. IMO, 'I'm sorry, we're an independent franchise and we can't afford to take back used items' would have been a much better response.\n\nOne other story. Last year, I bought a push mower at Lowes. I tried it and it wasn't sufficient. I took it back and got a more powerful mower. They took it back no questions asked. Had I bought it at this Ace? Nope, no returns on used items. I could be wrong but I also assume you can't  bring back defectives items (it's under warranty so deal with the manufacturer?) I could be wrong there. But again, with all that's on my plate, I need easy returns. With all that said, I wish this store well.

So far, I have had no results, and I am hard pressed to even get any kind of communication from the agent there, Carol.  There have been other houses near mine renting in as little as 2 weeks, but no such luck with my house.  I have made all the repairs they suggested, and we agreed on the rental amount.  However, I get the feeling they really aren't trying to get my house rented out.  I asked them to take a few more pictures of the inside of my home; this would show some of the good features of the interior.  It has been a couple of weeks, and this request still hasn't been done.  Furthermore, I have asked for follow up information via email twice in the past two weeks, and have had no response.\nI recently was advised by another realtor to post a listing on Craig\u2019s List.  She made this recommendation since she said no many people use the MLS for rental, at least yet.

I continued to rash up, took pictures of it. The rash would cime and go.  I couldnt take the pain medications given, but I took the Phenergan. Dr. Bassett started refusing to give me the Phenergan. This went on for a year. I found a test online that tested for metals allergy.  I went to a doctor in bham and had 8 large yellow tubes of blood drawn. She sent the test off it came back that I was allegic to titanium. Dr. Bassett with test results in hand still would not remove the plate and screws. His exact words were he had never seen anyone allergic to titanium nor was he taking the plate out for a rash.I later found that Phenergan is a histamine blocker so that was the reason I did not react all of the time while taking it and it helped with the pain. I had to go to another surgeon to have the plate removed. It has taken several years for my body to rid itself of the posion caused by titanium.  Even after the plate remival i became very sick, and had to leave my because I was unable to work. The blood test is called the MELISA test. This test should be ran by physicians in Alabama not just in Wisconsin.

He cares about his work, his patients, and his staff. He is very passionate about his profession, and his patients. Writing a review about him not refilling your prescription based only on your \"word\" that pills were stolen from your pill bottle is quite RIDICULOUS! There are rules and regulations that ANY doctor has to follow.Just because you said someone stole them does not mean it is true. (If it was true I am truly am sorry for you.) But once again that is not the Doctors fault and should not have to feel that it is. He has a family to take care of at home and he should not have to and will not have to put his career and income on the line for you. Also if the doctor was the one that asked all the questions why should he pay a nurse to do it?? THAT IS WHAT HE HIRED HER/HIM FOR.  He has a Nurse to get your info, symptoms, and general questions and concerns relays these things to the doctor and he comes in recommends what you need and gets you ready to go. My question to you is if you were so concerned about him not asking questions why did you not ask him questions on your concerns???? Works both ways. Make sure your fingers are clean before you bash someones career and office. No one forced the medicine on you, he simply recommended this to you. It's your choice to follow through with it. Or since your all about asking questions why didn't you ask if there was another alternative for you since you were breast feeding. Make sense huh!!!! I could go on and on about the ignorance of people to right reviews because they didn't get there way. If you don't like what a Doctor recommends for you by all means find a new Doctor that more fits you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c244efada5b:0xfa1ff97768a2db3f"}

I took it back up here and they said they would attempt to get someone to repair it. A few weeks later they said they tried multiple places, each one could not repair the Xbox One. They apparently could not get a video out signal, despite me telling them to wait 20-30 minutes for the included error code. I could reproduce this issue every time. I got a $100 refund and got to keep the Xbox One. That is very generous of them, and I thank them for that. However, I was given a power supply with no screws, it was held together with tape, and it seems like it's missing components, as seen by the empty pin header in the photo. I was going to attempt repair myself, but I no longer have a working power supply, as when I did when I dropped it off to be fixed. This may be the fault of whoever they took it to in order to get it repaired, but everything should have been independently tested after each repair attempt IMO. I just bought a new One S bundle after two failed Ones, this one being the second.\n\nEdit: After a trip back up here, they replaced the power supply, no questions asked. They might make mistakes, sometimes no fault of their own, but they do try to make it right. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nThe PS3 I bought for $75 is thankfully another story.

The dance is extremely hard on the feet, and sadly, she suffered a Jones Fracture while practicing.

He actually pulled up a video of Irish Dancing to see what stress is put on the feet, and based on the high level of stress she puts her feet through, he recommended to have a surgical screw put into the bone to ensure faster healing and to greatly decrease the chance of reinjury to this weakened area.  His nursing staff was very responsive to my many questions left on voice mail, getting back to me right away.

He is a great negotiator and not only did I win my case, but Attorney Howie added a modification to my support order that requires my ex to notify me within 30 days of a promotion and pay increase.

A quick google search finds that you are a newly licensed real estate agent here in Huntsville, and therefore a competitor of our business.  In fact, you are brokered by a company I do many successful deals with every year.  I find it quite troubling that you would try to damage our reputation when my wife and I have worked so hard to build and maintain a 5-star rating over the course of the past 8 years.  We have helped hundreds of local homeowners sell their homes, and collectively saved them hundreds of thousands of dollars in traditional real estate commissions.  Our actual customers absolutely love the service we offer.  And in fact, the agents that we personally interact with also appreciate our promptness and professionalism.  Lastly, I would point out that your leaving a review on a competitor's company is a direct violation of the NAR's Code of Ethics...from NAR...\"REALTORS\u00ae do not attempt to gain any unfair advantage over their competitors; and they refrain from making unsolicited comments about other practitioners.\"\nDue to the obvious conflict of interest of being a competitor, we respectfully request that you remove this review.

Kristina was very quick to see me. I only had to wait a few minutes before she came right in and was very easy to talk to. She immediately assessed my eye and told me she would be right back after she made a few calls. She came back within minutes after calling around to every eye doctor nearby and told me that unfortunately they were all closed at the time. But she recommended for me to use antibiotic eye drops and to go to Callahan over the weekend if it was not better because they were the only 24 hr eye doctors. She was very detailed in telling me exactly what to do and she listened to every concern I had. I appreciated the fact that she had called around to try and reach out for help since it was an eye incident and she knew there was only so much she could do. I would 10/10 recommend Kristina Parker, CRNP as she was very thorough and very diligent in helping me.

I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

The older woman, is blunt, and because of her strong accent I am sure she almost meant no harm but she was very, very, very, impatient.  As a matter of fact, as we were utilizing self-checkout at Wal-Mart I noticed her sit down, take a deep breath and I knew instantly we were in for a treat because she'd have to get up to service seconds after sitting down.  We took a chance anyway and to our surprise, she was the more pleasant employee of the two.  The younger lady/girl (maybe early to mid-twenties) was rude, she rushed our order, got the order wrong several times, became frustrated with us and said, \"ok, what you want,  I am confused so please what do you want.\"  If we weren't dealing with a \"time crunch\" and needed to eat as our day continued, they would have made 2 sandwiches that they could have eaten themselves or tossed in the trash.

The mustard greens looked great, however the taste wasn't recognizable.\nI hope this resturant uses this for improvement & not insulting.  I left a tip anyway.\nSorry folks...  You can not imagine our disappointment, as well as our dissatisfaction.\nThank you", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88620aba9967f013:0x5dd167d7ec98ad3e"}

I had the hot Italian sandwich, it was warm and loaded with flavor. Our group of four also tried the daily special, the Philly and a BLT. The Philly cheese steak is really close to the ones I used to get on Bridge street near my grandmother's house in Philadelphia. The food was great, served quick and the staff was helpful and friendly. Price was a touch high in my opinion but I still feel it was worth it. This place is also veteran friendly!

We totally respect your point of view. However the public deserves our point of view. Not saying that we are correct either, but there is an absolutely misunderstanding. Based on our communications, we last heard from Mr. Sweeney on Monday, and understood that he was coming back Tuesday morning. The person who ended up purchasing the vehicle, came on Wednesday afternoon. Although he was approved with financing  prior to your son on this vehicle, we informed him that the car was pending sale. We were under the impression that at least by Wednesday your son would have let us know if you got his financing to purchase the vehicle. We did send a bill of sale on Monday to his bank, but we did not hear from him or his bank for several days to assure us we were going forward with this purchase. We attempted to communicate with Mr. Sweeney to make sure that he was still coming and since our attempts were unanswered, and this other young man came ready Thursday morning to purchase with his finances straight, what are we to do when we had not heard from him? We are not pushy salesman  that badger people to see if they are coming back or not.\n\nJust to review the facts post sale, his loan officer got in contact with us and mentioned that he got your son's paper work approved on Wednesday PM. That would have been a wonderful time to respond to us to make sure the deal was still going forward.  Again, we are very sorry for your dismay and we hope you find another vehicle that meets your desire and needs."}, "gmap_id": "0x886269218dd87f65:0xf8ae8dec198a9bf3"}

After putting just over 300 miles on the vehicle, the engine seized.  The owner of the dealership would not get on the phone or call me back.  After talking to the lady in the office and her brother (Chris) , the only communication was via email.  I talked to Chris once but after that he would never call me back.  I called his cell phone multiple times but he never answered.  I was not able to leave a message on his cell phone since the service was not setup.\nBecause I didn't take the extended warranty, the dealership was not willing to help.  The vehicle was bought As-Is, but only after approximately 300 miles (100 was driving it home)  you would think a business would want to help their customers.  The only thing they did was give me a phone number of a company in VA to call about a used engine.  I called the number and the engine had sold months before and not even close to the price the dealership quoted me (off by $2000.00).  And if I did find an engine, their \"mechanic friend\" would install the engine for less than half of my mechanic (why would I trust their \"mechanic friend\" to touch my car after what has happened and their unwillingness to help).  But I would need to pay to have the vehicle towed another 100 miles to their mechanic.   Also, they seem to think that the two test drives I took should mean something, but it does not.  Two test drives does not give the buyer any insight on the internals of the engine (the engine sounded and responded fine on the test drives).  There have been multiple of other problems with the car since I purchased it.  I would strongly suggest that you think twice about buying a car from this dealership.\n\nSo the dealership responded to my review.  In the response they mention  to reimburse me a portion of the installation cost at their mechanic, but I refused.  That is not totally true.  I asked them to reimburse me a portion for the installation at my mechanic.  The said my mechanic was charging\na staggering amount.  But I didn't ask for the entire amount only half.  They would not reimburse me one cent if it was repaired at my mechanic.  Hence making the impression there is some relationship between the two businesses.  Why not reimburse me a portion of my mechanic's installation cost?  At least make an effort to offer a monitory amount.  That was never offered.  If I made the repairs on my own, there was no offer.  User their mechanic or get nothing.  I reiterate, I would not recommend buying a car from this dealer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886269218dd87f65:0xf8ae8dec198a9bf3"}

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

Great, but the issue here is that no one communicated with us that there would be a delay.  He talks in circles for a few minutes first blaming us, then the workers then he says he has \"no idea why they didn't come this morning\" ?? What?

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625061478074, "text": "Hello Mr. Phillis, We're very sorry to learn of your recent move experience.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

I went back and reviewed your paperwork and contact logs and I wanted to hopefully clear up some items for you. All of our trucks are 26 feet in length. While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know.

Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan.

Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

The pediatric section is fine (although with Dr. Roy's leaving, I'm not sure what direction this may take), the URGENT Care section is pretty standard, and the receptionists aren't particularly friendly, but they aren't particularly snippy or abrupt either. If not for my PCP, I would give SARHA a 4. It's pretty standard and effective as far as Health Organizations.\nHowever, Dr. Walters has been my PCP now for about a year. I have seen him twice and talked with him on the phone about 3 times. I haven't had a PCP in years. Due to circumstances, I have a cardiologist that I regularly follow up with and I started seeing an OB about 6 years ago when I was first pregnant. My OB has mainly acted in the place of a PCP for me.\nHowever, about a year ago, I required major open heart surgery. After this, many specialists were insistent that I acquire a PCP, and Dr. \"Jack\" Walters was the only one close to my area, so I followed through with that. I wish I had read reviews of him beforehand.\nHe is not only callous, but altogether pretty much useless. During my first visit to him (literally 2 weeks after being discharged from UAB, where I'd stayed for over a month) he told me there was nothing he could do for my feelings of sluggishness, tiredness, or depressive issues. If I wanted to feel better: diet and exercise. After my surgery, I developed an infection, so I called to try to schedule an appointment with him to have this taken care of locally - he refused. I also developed extreme dehydration which triggered an AFib, and guess what? He wouldn't treat me. He sent me back to a UAB specialist. Then when I developed a UTI.... you guessed it - back to UAB. The only time he didn't refuse to treat me was when I developed flu-like symptoms and saw him in URGENT care. He prescribed me some strong medication like tamaflu and sent me home.\nThe only thing he seemed useful for was to keep my prescriptions current. I take 40mg of Vibryd for depression and anxiety, and have for nearly 4 years. However, he cut that dose in half for me and prescribed 20 mg. Obviously, I thought this was a mistake so I didn't address it right away and I would take two 20mg to stay on my current 40mg dose, which was initially given to me by my OB, recommended by a therapist.\nWhen I called yesterday to ask for a refill, the secretary informed me that Dr. Walters would refuse to prescribe me any medication unless he saw me in clinic again, even though I saw him in September, about 7 months ago. Maybe I'm the only one who thought that an annual meant once a year, but okay. So, like I said: pretty much useless in my opinion.\nI'm not happy with the treatment, or lack of treatment, I've received from Dr. Walters, and I'm not happy about my medication situation. I would not recommend him to anyone, especially if you have a specialist or an OB that you have a fairly good working relationship with.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ded0fa015695d:0xbcb946f9bb2631cd"}

The store looks great and it's great to have a good hardware store so close. Also, the personnel were knowledgeable which usually is why I prefer stores like this over Big box retailers.\n\nSo I've had a day to consider my experience at this store. I was excited to have a reason to go to the new Ace store not too far from me. It didn't go well. And for perspective, I almost never strongly complain. But, to start, I'm exceptionally busy and need a place that is easy for transactions and returns. So, being busy, I went to the shed and found out I didn't have the key for the pad lock. I ran to Ace and picked up a small bolt cutter. Coming home, I tried twice on the lock and realized it was too small.\n\nReturning to the store, I tried to return the item within 30 minutes of purchase (with receipt) to buy a large Bolt cutter. This is when I found out about the 'no return' for used items policy. OK, I can accept that. I won't be able to shop there. But I accept that. The problem? From my perspective, the owner was rude. 'No, we won't take that back. It's used' he said. IMO, 'I'm sorry, we're an independent franchise and we can't afford to take back used items' would have been a much better response.\n\nOne other story. Last year, I bought a push mower at Lowes. I tried it and it wasn't sufficient. I took it back and got a more powerful mower. They took it back no questions asked. Had I bought it at this Ace? Nope, no returns on used items. I could be wrong but I also assume you can't  bring back defectives items (it's under warranty so deal with the manufacturer?) I could be wrong there. But again, with all that's on my plate, I need easy returns. With all that said, I wish this store well.

I don't think ANY dealership would replace a motor for free on a as is vehicle.\nIf you have ever financed anything you would know that you have to provide a lot of information to get approved. This is the reason you are asked by most places for proof of income and proof of residency. Businesses just don't operate by word of mouth. We need proof you make money and proof you live where you say you do. That's part of the finance business.  If that is to much then you probably won't be able to finance anything anywhere.\nHope you have a great day."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b9a510d1ab7:0x6d26912b670f96c5"}
