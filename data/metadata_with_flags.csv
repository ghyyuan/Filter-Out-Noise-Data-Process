Back in March, I ordered a crib converter to convert my child's crib to a toddler bed. I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do.

My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people.

On October 21, my wife(9 months pregnant) purchased a crib and double dresser from POSH MOMMY, located on Hwy 72 in Madison AL. The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, ‚Äòthat is not the way they do business‚Äô. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me ‚Äòthe truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.‚Äô I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa‚Äôs husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future.

We set up a fly time before leaving for vacation. The second day of vacation we showed up at Blue Reef's location. Knowing that vacation destinations that involve the beach can sometimes run on ""island time"" we showed up early. The staff had our confirmation and were ready for us when we arrived. Perfect!

Once on the boat, the captain made feel safe and relaxed. With music playing on the boat we (my wife and I)were strapped in and off to see the beach from an aerial view. It was a blast and I have the picture they toke to prove it.

We have been back once since and met up with the staff at Blue Reef once again. This time we rented jet skis and played in the water. We had a great time!

While most of the staff at Blue Reef Watersports are nice enough, the concept of customer service is completely foreign.  We paid for he photo package, but when our children returned from their parasailing, the staff said that the camera card had been misplaced...check back in an hour.  OK, we thought, no big deal.

We checked back in an hour, still no card, ""we'll bring your card to you when we close up shop for the night.""

No such luck.  They neither brought the card by nor called me to let me know what was going on.

The next morning, after finally reaching a manager, and explaining that we were departing that day, they agreed to take our kids back up during the lunch-hour just long enough to snap some pictures.

Another call back from the manager, however, and their story had changed again...the only slot open for the re-fly was 4:30pm.  As we were leaving after lunch, we simply couldn't accept that.

Our twins enjoyed the ride well enough, but the company's response to their mistake is simply inexcusable.

So I reschedule for another day, the appointment was made and they never showed. I called them again and they came to repair the work and I showed them some other spots that needed to be repaired.

Our tiling work is only 1/2 way complete so I cannot review the work only that the workers who came to our home have been very nice and my complaint has nothing to do with them.

Our tile work was supposed to be completed yesterday 10/8.  It did not get complete because some of the wood did not match our floor (100% understandable!) We were told they would be back this morning to complete the work.  My husband takes the morning off of work and we have a photographer scheduled at 1pm to take photos to put our house on the market.  The morning passes and we never hear from anyone.  Finally my husband messages the worker directly and he said that they erew coming this afternoon instead.  Someone from James Carpets was supposed to reach out to us.  My husband has to take the full day off work and now we need to wait to put our house on the market.  Here's where the problem happened:

I call the store to see what happened.  When I explain the situation to the lady who answered her reply was ""well, those phones fail us all the time dont they?  Is there anything else you need?"" I asked for a Manager to call me. Someone called about an hour later and his response was almost unbelievable.  He explained that they had to change the wood. Great, but the issue here is that no one communicated with us that there would be a delay.  He talks in circles for a few minutes first blaming us, then the workers then he says he has ""no idea why they didn't come this morning"" ?? What?  We all understand why they didn't come the issue is with why someone didn't communicate this to us which caused a major inconvenience.

I do not recommend this company.  Good customer service is NOT difficult at all but obviously not something that they care about.",0x88626b2e333be6d9:0x2a00a09a7045984f,James Carpets of Huntsville,34.76051,-86.58796,Flooring store,4.2,38,True,duplicate same biz; multi business same time (same category: Flooring store); extreme rating (diff from avg: 3.2)

We used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.

My issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.

A few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn‚Äôt have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn‚Äôt have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it‚Äôs stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.",0x889a4c5600ae3917:0x323715d12942ec3d,Two Men and a Truck,30.646897499999998,-88.1290243,Mover,4.5,204,True,duplicate same biz; multi business same time (same category: Mover); extreme rating (diff from avg: 3.5)

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don‚Äôt have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor‚Äôs behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.

I don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.

You may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.

I wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.

The nearest scale is the CAT scale at the TA exit 168 in Montgomery. Round trip 12 miles. Total time was 4-1/2 hours.

She didn't even get any pictures of the bride and father dance, none of the wedding favor's table, or food table.  All those pictures came from family who took their own pictures and sent it to the bride. The bride was very upset because of the money she spent to capture her one and only wedding day and to be told that most of the pictures were destroyed only after she kept hassling the photographer for months. Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

Her daughter got so drunk (she's like 26 ) and she was all over my 15 year old nephew, it was disgusting behavior. She didn't even get me walking out where they introduced us as husband and wife. I got the pictures back and I was very disappointed.  The pictures were off centered and she didn't tell me to do any poses, I had to come up with everything. All in all, not professional in my opinion.",0x8890c05c4ee01179:0xbfce2030e2e917e2,Shannonography,31.219436299999998,-88.1051075,Wedding photographer,4.4,38,True,duplicate same biz; multi business same time (same category: Wedding photographer); extreme rating (diff from avg: 3.4)

I couldn't be happier.  She also offered our family and guests a discounted rate for family pics while we we were in town.  We plan on coming back in a few months, as we just found out we are expecting and want her to capture the start of our family.  If we can, we plan on coming back every year and doing family pics.

She also has a terrible attitude like she didn't really want to be there.  She also missed a deadline for the video to be ready for us and when questioned by my wife she was defensive and said she would issue refund immediately and destroy the video which we assume she did and then had the nerve to threaten my wife with a lawsuit for slander if she were to leave her a negative review claiming she had a lawyer on retainer for anyone leaving a poor review.  No professional in any industry would ever say such a thing unless they knew they were wrong and felt the need to try and bully rather then use customer service to fix whatever situation had arisen!

Does she know the time it takes for Covid-19 to spread is it a short time or a long time? Apparently she works for the CDC and she knows all about it to discriminate against who wears a mask and who does not.

Today, I missed my mail pick up and our local post office had already closed so we drove down to this store so that we could ensure our packages would go out today.

So, I then took the packages and went inside only to be told that, ""I don't receive anything from the Post Office for compensation and am not required to provide service to you.""   I asked for her to put that in writing, she refused, spewed some other nastiness until 2 other individuals came in and I told her I would be reporting her to the proper authorities and I left.   As I type this, I am still shaken, that this kind of bigotry and hatred can still exist.  That people feel they have the right to treat others with such vile.

The pediatric section is fine (although with Dr. Roy's leaving, I'm not sure what direction this may take), the URGENT Care section is pretty standard, and the receptionists aren't particularly friendly, but they aren't particularly snippy or abrupt either. If not for my PCP, I would give SARHA a 4. It's pretty standard and effective as far as Health Organizations.
However, Dr. Walters has been my PCP now for about a year. I have seen him twice and talked with him on the phone about 3 times. I haven't had a PCP in years. Due to circumstances, I have a cardiologist that I regularly follow up with and I started seeing an OB about 6 years ago when I was first pregnant. My OB has mainly acted in the place of a PCP for me.
However, about a year ago, I required major open heart surgery. After this, many specialists were insistent that I acquire a PCP, and Dr. ""Jack"" Walters was the only one close to my area, so I followed through with that. I wish I had read reviews of him beforehand.
He is not only callous, but altogether pretty much useless. During my first visit to him (literally 2 weeks after being discharged from UAB, where I'd stayed for over a month) he told me there was nothing he could do for my feelings of sluggishness, tiredness, or depressive issues. If I wanted to feel better: diet and exercise. After my surgery, I developed an infection, so I called to try to schedule an appointment with him to have this taken care of locally - he refused. I also developed extreme dehydration which triggered an AFib, and guess what? He wouldn't treat me. He sent me back to a UAB specialist. Then when I developed a UTI.... you guessed it - back to UAB. The only time he didn't refuse to treat me was when I developed flu-like symptoms and saw him in URGENT care. He prescribed me some strong medication like tamaflu and sent me home.
The only thing he seemed useful for was to keep my prescriptions current. I take 40mg of Vibryd for depression and anxiety, and have for nearly 4 years. However, he cut that dose in half for me and prescribed 20 mg. Obviously, I thought this was a mistake so I didn't address it right away and I would take two 20mg to stay on my current 40mg dose, which was initially given to me by my OB, recommended by a therapist.
When I called yesterday to ask for a refill, the secretary informed me that Dr. Walters would refuse to prescribe me any medication unless he saw me in clinic again, even though I saw him in September, about 7 months ago. Maybe I'm the only one who thought that an annual meant once a year, but okay. So, like I said: pretty much useless in my opinion.
I'm not happy with the treatment, or lack of treatment, I've received from Dr. Walters, and I'm not happy about my medication situation. I would not recommend him to anyone, especially if you have a specialist or an OB that you have a fairly good working relationship with.",0x888ded0fa015695d:0xbcb946f9bb2631cd,Southeast Alabama Rural Health Associates,31.7652172,-85.9605539,Doctor,4.1,127,True,duplicate same biz; multi business same time (same category: Doctor)

Wonderful little coffee shop. This place has all the usual hot or cold coffee favorites with great sugar free options, plus a full food menu.. They cook everything in waffle makers, but that doesn't limit their selection.  All of their products (drinks and food) are fantastic.  They also have some amazing pastries at the front. The Rockslide Brownie is awesome.

There's plenty of wifi and seating room to relax, study, or work. Everything seemed clean and well organized. The staff is quick and friendly.

The store looks great and it's great to have a good hardware store so close. Also, the personnel were knowledgeable which usually is why I prefer stores like this over Big box retailers.

So I've had a day to consider my experience at this store. I was excited to have a reason to go to the new Ace store not too far from me. It didn't go well. And for perspective, I almost never strongly complain. But, to start, I'm exceptionally busy and need a place that is easy for transactions and returns. So, being busy, I went to the shed and found out I didn't have the key for the pad lock. I ran to Ace and picked up a small bolt cutter. Coming home, I tried twice on the lock and realized it was too small.

Returning to the store, I tried to return the item within 30 minutes of purchase (with receipt) to buy a large Bolt cutter. This is when I found out about the 'no return' for used items policy. OK, I can accept that. I won't be able to shop there. But I accept that. The problem? From my perspective, the owner was rude. 'No, we won't take that back. It's used' he said. IMO, 'I'm sorry, we're an independent franchise and we can't afford to take back used items' would have been a much better response.

One other story. Last year, I bought a push mower at Lowes. I tried it and it wasn't sufficient. I took it back and got a more powerful mower. They took it back no questions asked. Had I bought it at this Ace? Nope, no returns on used items. I could be wrong but I also assume you can't  bring back defectives items (it's under warranty so deal with the manufacturer?) I could be wrong there. But again, with all that's on my plate, I need easy returns. With all that said, I wish this store well.

The owner said they were closed for the season, he‚Äôs sorry, and directed us to the nearest farm which was another 30 min away. We had already driven an hr. Not even 5 min later we got a call back from the owner. He said that he saw he was showing as open on google and since that‚Äôs the reason we came he would meet us at the farm so that we can pick out a Christmas tree of our liking! This business owner knows how to make his customers happy and shows great love for others and the holidays! He‚Äôs a very kind and humble man. We ended up cutting ourselves a beautiful tree. On top of such an amazing experience, the owner has a Christmas light show that runs for about 30 min where the lights are in sync with the music. I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful for this kind heart.

I'm from California, and while visiting I spotted a nail salon inside of the Walmart. That should have been a red flag, but I needed a full set and a pedicure. So the young lady (pregnant manager) offered to help but didn't say 2 words to me. She was rude, had an attitude, and ignored me when I told her I wanted my nails a certain way. Once she was done, I looked at my nails  and couldn't walk out with my nails looking that way, so I asked her to fix my nails. At the time, she was looking at a video on her phone, and when I asked to talk to her, she ignore me. I was never rude to this woman, and continued to be polite even after her rude ass continued to ignore me. So at that point, I lost it!!!! She refused to do my nails, so the younger gentleman working there offered to do my nails, and they were worse.

I introduced my husband to BBVA Compass bank because I was a satisfied long time account holder, but I've since regretted advising him, as a foreign national, to open an account there. We have made multiple visits to attempt to have correct information on his account and discuss the ""extended overdraft fee"" being taken from his account on the same day his paycheck is directly deposited. Chris Ballard is the one we spoke with on our last visit, Friday. We waited patiently for someone and he came in from outdoors and invited us in the office. He was shaking and trembling and seemed agitated before we even got down to business.  The meeting ended with him yelling and demanding that I be quiet and let him finish talking. At this point I had already witnessed him becoming increasingly agitated and shaking but with him becoming red in the face and yelling, we decided to leave with plans on closing both our accounts In the near future.",0x88626b6a440529fb:0x4f04a9cb14ce4402,BBVA Bank,34.7452259,-86.60244709999999,Bank,3.4,5,False,

She had some tacos and I got a Torta de Milanesa de Pollo. We talked at length with the very friendly cook, before departing to put our meal to the test. We were transported home to Chi-town with the first bite. This is the real deal. Dip or pour the verde or rojo sauce, but you've got to try it. These guys are amazing.

I immediately started noticing rushing the day that i waz released frim the hospital. I called hus surgical assistant, and was told it was a reaction to the anesthesia. I continued to rash up, took pictures of it. The rash would cime and go.  I couldnt take the pain medications given, but I took the Phenergan. Dr. Bassett started refusing to give me the Phenergan. This went on for a year. I found a test online that tested for metals allergy.  I went to a doctor in bham and had 8 large yellow tubes of blood drawn. She sent the test off it came back that I was allegic to titanium. Dr. Bassett with test results in hand still would not remove the plate and screws. His exact words were he had never seen anyone allergic to titanium nor was he taking the plate out for a rash.I later found that Phenergan is a histamine blocker so that was the reason I did not react all of the time while taking it and it helped with the pain. I had to go to another surgeon to have the plate removed. It has taken several years for my body to rid itself of the posion caused by titanium.  Even after the plate remival i became very sick, and had to leave my because I was unable to work. The blood test is called the MELISA test. This test should be ran by physicians in Alabama not just in Wisconsin.

It took several calls to get them to come back and remediate the job. Then I noticed one of the gutters they put up was sagging in the middle preventing the water from draining. I called Josh the owner I believe. He said to send pictures which I did and have a confirmation of receipt. When I tried to call him to confirm receipt he had blocked my number. The next day I called him from a different number he answered and said he did not get the pictures which I had confirmation of his receiving. I told him I would resend them. He told me his salesman Brandon would call me ASAP. I am still waiting for Brandon's call. There are many good honest companies doing gutter guard work.

He cares about his work, his patients, and his staff. He is very passionate about his profession, and his patients. Writing a review about him not refilling your prescription based only on your ""word"" that pills were stolen from your pill bottle is quite RIDICULOUS! There are rules and regulations that ANY doctor has to follow.Just because you said someone stole them does not mean it is true. (If it was true I am truly am sorry for you.) But once again that is not the Doctors fault and should not have to feel that it is. He has a family to take care of at home and he should not have to and will not have to put his career and income on the line for you. Also if the doctor was the one that asked all the questions why should he pay a nurse to do it?? THAT IS WHAT HE HIRED HER/HIM FOR.  He has a Nurse to get your info, symptoms, and general questions and concerns relays these things to the doctor and he comes in recommends what you need and gets you ready to go. My question to you is if you were so concerned about him not asking questions why did you not ask him questions on your concerns???? Works both ways. Make sure your fingers are clean before you bash someones career and office. No one forced the medicine on you, he simply recommended this to you. It's your choice to follow through with it. Or since your all about asking questions why didn't you ask if there was another alternative for you since you were breast feeding. Make sense huh!!!! I could go on and on about the ignorance of people to right reviews because they didn't get there way.

I worked in this office and saw the fraud first hand. There is a problem when individuals are bragging about having their 5th child just because it is going to make their rent go down. Section 8 has become a crutch and has enabled people to solely love off the tax payers money. They don't want to work because the government supplies them with their every need. It's sickening! The manager of this office is also impossible to work for. As white man I felt discriminated against on a daily basis. The Section 8 program is bad news.

I took it back up here and they said they would attempt to get someone to repair it. A few weeks later they said they tried multiple places, each one could not repair the Xbox One. They apparently could not get a video out signal, despite me telling them to wait 20-30 minutes for the included error code. I could reproduce this issue every time. I got a $100 refund and got to keep the Xbox One. That is very generous of them, and I thank them for that. However, I was given a power supply with no screws, it was held together with tape, and it seems like it's missing components, as seen by the empty pin header in the photo. I was going to attempt repair myself, but I no longer have a working power supply, as when I did when I dropped it off to be fixed. This may be the fault of whoever they took it to in order to get it repaired, but everything should have been independently tested after each repair attempt IMO. I just bought a new One S bundle after two failed Ones, this one being the second.

Edit: After a trip back up here, they replaced the power supply, no questions asked. They might make mistakes, sometimes no fault of their own, but they do try to make it right. üëç

Our daughter is a competitive Open Champ Irish Dancer, dancing 8 hours a week in Nashville and practicing on her own many more hours. The dance is extremely hard on the feet, and sadly, she suffered a Jones Fracture while practicing. It‚Äôs a somewhat common injury for dancers/athletes and doesn‚Äôt always heal well due to low blood flow to this particular area of the foot.

Dr. Kyle is super attentive; we never felt rushed during the appointments! He actually pulled up a video of Irish Dancing to see what stress is put on the feet, and based on the high level of stress she puts her feet through, he recommended to have a surgical screw put into the bone to ensure faster healing and to greatly decrease the chance of reinjury to this weakened area.  His nursing staff was very responsive to my many questions left on voice mail, getting back to me right away.

There was no sign or any indication that no one was in the building except the lights being off. The sign posted on the door and all of the internet signage says they close at 4:30 I arrived at exactly 4. When I call to ask was anyone there I was told, Sorry we had to leave early. I explained my issue with hopes of them offering me a better time to come back or a discount I was told ....again with less compassion than the first time sorry for the inconvenience. I work 9 to 5 Monday through Friday when they are open I had to make special arrangements for that time off. They clearly don't care so I went to Furlongs. They were there. The work is beautiful and was fast.   I was also treated with a discount for this company's grave inconsideration for PAYING customers Edit: I originally gave 2 stars without comment, but after being harrassed for my rating I dropped to one.

As a result, my case was settled by dismissal and I never sat foot into the courtroom. This was trully a blessing as I like to keep my family and personal affairs out of any forms of public veiwings.

Everything our table of 9 ordered was outstanding...freshly prepared and full of flavor!

The two appetizers were incredible...Fried banana peppers and fried bacon wrapped pickles! They sound weird but were fantastic! Fried, crispy and absolute perfection.

Absolute standouts included the pork ribs (come early before they sell out), white mac n cheese, chicken quesadilla, Bootsie's dog (sausage dog with BBQ), and even the kids meal were homemade chicken nuggets.

Took a banana pudding and key lime pie to go. Amazing!!!!

I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another ""potential student"" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different ""potential"" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready.

The 2 women working, (one older, on younger) were perhaps the most impatient Subway employees I have EVER come across.  The older woman, is blunt, and because of her strong accent I am sure she almost meant no harm but she was very, very, very, impatient.  As a matter of fact, as we were utilizing self-checkout at Wal-Mart I noticed her sit down, take a deep breath and I knew instantly we were in for a treat because she'd have to get up to service seconds after sitting down.  We took a chance anyway and to our surprise, she was the more pleasant employee of the two.  The younger lady/girl (maybe early to mid-twenties) was rude, she rushed our order, got the order wrong several times, became frustrated with us and said, ""ok, what you want,  I am confused so please what do you want.""

The owner of the dealership would not get on the phone or call me back.  After talking to the lady in the office and her brother (Chris) , the only communication was via email.  I talked to Chris once but after that he would never call me back.  I called his cell phone multiple times but he never answered.  I was not able to leave a message on his cell phone since the service was not setup.
Because I didn't take the extended warranty, the dealership was not willing to help.  The vehicle was bought As-Is, but only after approximately 300 miles (100 was driving it home)  you would think a business would want to help their customers.  The only thing they did was give me a phone number of a company in VA to call about a used engine.  I called the number and the engine had sold months before and not even close to the price the dealership quoted me (off by $2000.00).  And if I did find an engine, their ""mechanic friend"" would install the engine for less than half of my mechanic (why would I trust their ""mechanic friend"" to touch my car after what has happened and their unwillingness to help).  But I would need to pay to have the vehicle towed another 100 miles to their mechanic.   Also, they seem to think that the two test drives I took should mean something, but it does not.  Two test drives does not give the buyer any insight on the internals of the engine (the engine sounded and responded fine on the test drives).  There have been multiple of other problems with the car since I purchased it.  I would strongly suggest that you think twice about buying a car from this dealership.

So the dealership responded to my review.  In the response they mention  to reimburse me a portion of the installation cost at their mechanic, but I refused.  That is not totally true.  I asked them to reimburse me a portion for the installation at my mechanic.  The said my mechanic was charging
a staggering amount.  But I didn't ask for the entire amount only half.  They would not reimburse me one cent if it was repaired at my mechanic.  Hence making the impression there is some relationship between the two businesses.  Why not reimburse me a portion of my mechanic's installation cost?  At least make an effort to offer a monitory amount.  That was never offered.  If I made the repairs on my own, there was no offer.  User their mechanic or get nothing.  I reiterate, I would not recommend buying a car from this dealer.",0x886269218dd87f65:0xf8ae8dec198a9bf3,Fastlane Motor Sales,34.7682734,-86.89536849999999,Used car dealer,4.8,129,True,extreme rating (diff from avg: 3.8)

Back in March, I ordered a crib converter to convert my child's crib to a toddler bed. I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.

My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this.

On October 21, my wife(9 months pregnant) purchased a crib and double dresser from POSH MOMMY, located on Hwy 72 in Madison AL. The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, ‚Äòthat is not the way they do business‚Äô. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me ‚Äòthe truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.‚Äô I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa‚Äôs husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future.

We set up a fly time before leaving for vacation. The second day of vacation we showed up at Blue Reef's location. Knowing that vacation destinations that involve the beach can sometimes run on ""island time"" we showed up early. The staff had our confirmation and were ready for us when we arrived. Perfect!

Once on the boat, the captain made feel safe and relaxed. With music playing on the boat we (my wife and I)were strapped in and off to see the beach from an aerial view. It was a blast and I have the picture they toke to prove it.

We have been back once since and met up with the staff at Blue Reef once again. This time we rented jet skis and played in the water. We had a great time!

While most of the staff at Blue Reef Watersports are nice enough, the concept of customer service is completely foreign.  We paid for he photo package, but when our children returned from their parasailing, the staff said that the camera card had been misplaced...check back in an hour.  OK, we thought, no big deal.

We checked back in an hour, still no card, ""we'll bring your card to you when we close up shop for the night.""

No such luck.  They neither brought the card by nor called me to let me know what was going on.

The next morning, after finally reaching a manager, and explaining that we were departing that day, they agreed to take our kids back up during the lunch-hour just long enough to snap some pictures.

Another call back from the manager, however, and their story had changed again...the only slot open for the re-fly was 4:30pm.  As we were leaving after lunch, we simply couldn't accept that.

Our twins enjoyed the ride well enough, but the company's response to their mistake is simply inexcusable.

Our tiling work is only 1/2 way complete so I cannot review the work only that the workers who came to our home have been very nice and my complaint has nothing to do with them.

Our tile work was supposed to be completed yesterday 10/8.  It did not get complete because some of the wood did not match our floor (100% understandable!) We were told they would be back this morning to complete the work.  My husband takes the morning off of work and we have a photographer scheduled at 1pm to take photos to put our house on the market.  The morning passes and we never hear from anyone.  Finally my husband messages the worker directly and he said that they erew coming this afternoon instead.  Someone from James Carpets was supposed to reach out to us.  My husband has to take the full day off work and now we need to wait to put our house on the market.  Here's where the problem happened:

I call the store to see what happened.  When I explain the situation to the lady who answered her reply was ""well, those phones fail us all the time dont they?  Is there anything else you need?"" I asked for a Manager to call me. Someone called about an hour later and his response was almost unbelievable.  He explained that they had to change the wood. Great, but the issue here is that no one communicated with us that there would be a delay.  He talks in circles for a few minutes first blaming us, then the workers then he says he has ""no idea why they didn't come this morning"" ?? What?  We all understand why they didn't come the issue is with why someone didn't communicate this to us which caused a major inconvenience.

I do not recommend this company.

We used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.

My issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.

A few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn‚Äôt have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn‚Äôt have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it‚Äôs stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.",0x889a4c5600ae3917:0x323715d12942ec3d,Two Men and a Truck,30.646897499999998,-88.1290243,Mover,4.5,204,True,duplicate same biz; multi business same time (same category: Mover); extreme rating (diff from avg: 3.5)

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don‚Äôt have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor‚Äôs behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.

I don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.

You may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.

I wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't.

Another driver stated it had taken 3-1/2 hours to unload, and now he's had to wait 15 minutes already for his paperwork. He stated he'd already called the number on the paper and someone would be on the way shortly. 15 minutes later when the clerk arrived, I was informed I had to have either an empty weight and loaded weight scale ticket from the same scale, on the same day as I picked up the load, or, I would need to go and get a loaded weight scale ticket, bring it back to get unloaded, then go back and get an empty weight scale ticket, and bring it back in order to receive my completed paperwork. The nearest scale is the CAT scale at the TA exit 168 in Montgomery. Round trip 12 miles. Total time was 4-1/2 hours. Be careful if you have to turnaround at the north end, I saw 2 torn off mud flaps lying in the dirt where drivers backed over the curb.

While getting dressed she spent more time taking pictures of the wedding rings than of the girls and the bride. After the ceremony she kept asking what kind of poses we wanted to do instead of being creative and telling us. During the reception she walked around smoking, at the bar, fixing a to go plate which were plenty of real plates because we were at a nice restaurant (she just chose to grab a to go plate because she wanted food to go, so you a lie!) and eating off the kids buffet (which was for children 12 and under only, you wrote it yourself). She didn't even get any pictures of the bride and father dance, none of the wedding favor's table, or food table.  All those pictures came from family who took their own pictures and sent it to the bride. The bride was very upset because of the money she spent to capture her one and only wedding day and to be told that most of the pictures were destroyed only after she kept hassling the photographer for months.

The lady on the phone assured me they had chicken, then she preceded to tell me it would be 20-25 minutes for fresh chicken. I drove to the store to find NO chicken! I asked why when I‚Äôd just called?  She the deli manager who had came in on her off day said and I quote it hasn‚Äôt been 25 minutes. After talking with Tim the person who was in charge, he took me into a small office to give me the managers phone number and told me he was trying to get me away from her so she‚Äôd shut up.
Once I walked to the exit door she said something loud enough for me to hear, I asked her if she had something to say I was right there to say it to my face, not as I was leaving. She then threatened to call the police.
I‚Äôve never in my entire life been treated so rudely by a person in customer service. I‚Äôve been in customer service for more than 25 years and wouldn‚Äôt hire this woman to take out my trash!!  Obviously she was not happy about being called into do her job therefore it showed in the way she treated me.
I sent my husband to the store just to verify what type of customer service I‚Äôd received.  He also noticed the negative attitude from the lady and the fact that the person in charge wasn‚Äôt taking responsibility for his coworkers actions.  We‚Äôre locals and stop by there quite often to purchase boat gas and chicken. I highly suggest this person be retrained with the way she speaks to her customers.

There was a lady in front of me that went in no mask on and the lady at the counter told her just to put her package over there. I came in with no mask on she told me to go back out and get a mask! Does she know the time it takes for Covid-19 to spread is it a short time or a long time? Apparently she works for the CDC and she knows all about it to discriminate against who wears a mask and who does not. If that service wasn't bad enough they charged me $51 to ship a golf club which normally would cost $39 anywhere else.

The pediatric section is fine (although with Dr. Roy's leaving, I'm not sure what direction this may take), the URGENT Care section is pretty standard, and the receptionists aren't particularly friendly, but they aren't particularly snippy or abrupt either. If not for my PCP, I would give SARHA a 4. It's pretty standard and effective as far as Health Organizations.
However, Dr. Walters has been my PCP now for about a year. I have seen him twice and talked with him on the phone about 3 times. I haven't had a PCP in years. Due to circumstances, I have a cardiologist that I regularly follow up with and I started seeing an OB about 6 years ago when I was first pregnant. My OB has mainly acted in the place of a PCP for me.
However, about a year ago, I required major open heart surgery. After this, many specialists were insistent that I acquire a PCP, and Dr. ""Jack"" Walters was the only one close to my area, so I followed through with that. I wish I had read reviews of him beforehand.
He is not only callous, but altogether pretty much useless. During my first visit to him (literally 2 weeks after being discharged from UAB, where I'd stayed for over a month) he told me there was nothing he could do for my feelings of sluggishness, tiredness, or depressive issues. If I wanted to feel better: diet and exercise. After my surgery, I developed an infection, so I called to try to schedule an appointment with him to have this taken care of locally - he refused. I also developed extreme dehydration which triggered an AFib, and guess what? He wouldn't treat me. He sent me back to a UAB specialist. Then when I developed a UTI.... you guessed it - back to UAB. The only time he didn't refuse to treat me was when I developed flu-like symptoms and saw him in URGENT care. He prescribed me some strong medication like tamaflu and sent me home.
The only thing he seemed useful for was to keep my prescriptions current. I take 40mg of Vibryd for depression and anxiety, and have for nearly 4 years. However, he cut that dose in half for me and prescribed 20 mg. Obviously, I thought this was a mistake so I didn't address it right away and I would take two 20mg to stay on my current 40mg dose, which was initially given to me by my OB, recommended by a therapist.
When I called yesterday to ask for a refill, the secretary informed me that Dr. Walters would refuse to prescribe me any medication unless he saw me in clinic again, even though I saw him in September, about 7 months ago. Maybe I'm the only one who thought that an annual meant once a year, but okay. So, like I said: pretty much useless in my opinion.
I'm not happy with the treatment, or lack of treatment, I've received from Dr. Walters, and I'm not happy about my medication situation. I would not recommend him to anyone, especially if you have a specialist or an OB that you have a fairly good working relationship with.",0x888ded0fa015695d:0xbcb946f9bb2631cd,Southeast Alabama Rural Health Associates,31.7652172,-85.9605539,Doctor,4.1,127,True,duplicate same biz; multi business same time (same category: Doctor)

The store looks great and it's great to have a good hardware store so close. Also, the personnel were knowledgeable which usually is why I prefer stores like this over Big box retailers.

So I've had a day to consider my experience at this store. I was excited to have a reason to go to the new Ace store not too far from me. It didn't go well. And for perspective, I almost never strongly complain. But, to start, I'm exceptionally busy and need a place that is easy for transactions and returns. So, being busy, I went to the shed and found out I didn't have the key for the pad lock. I ran to Ace and picked up a small bolt cutter. Coming home, I tried twice on the lock and realized it was too small.

Returning to the store, I tried to return the item within 30 minutes of purchase (with receipt) to buy a large Bolt cutter. This is when I found out about the 'no return' for used items policy. OK, I can accept that. I won't be able to shop there. But I accept that. The problem? From my perspective, the owner was rude. 'No, we won't take that back. It's used' he said. IMO, 'I'm sorry, we're an independent franchise and we can't afford to take back used items' would have been a much better response.

One other story. Last year, I bought a push mower at Lowes. I tried it and it wasn't sufficient. I took it back and got a more powerful mower. They took it back no questions asked. Had I bought it at this Ace? Nope, no returns on used items. I could be wrong but I also assume you can't  bring back defectives items (it's under warranty so deal with the manufacturer?) I could be wrong there. But again, with all that's on my plate, I need easy returns. With all that said, I wish this store well.

There was never any agreement between myself and WallZone to directly purchase any materials. I had been told by WallZone in Huntsville that the contractor, not WallZone, owned the materials and they had been paid for. I asked David why he tried to get me to purchase something that was already paid for by the contractor, and he refused to answer my question.

I then called a manager in Pelham, Mike, and was informed that the contractor already paid for the materials, WallZone had no money in the materials whatsoever (and wasn't needing a check from anyone), and that nobody had ever asked David to contact me regarding the materials. I was then told by the manager, who was laughing at David's attempt to steal from me, that WallZone would have just credited the contractor's account had they received a check from me.

I earned my GED since I have been here and I have developed a relationship with God....that I had never thought possible before. Rapha has honest dedicated Staff as well as all the Volunteers that participate with the ongoing activities here.  I would recommend this Program to anyone that is seeking help with addiction issues.......this place is so much more than just a Treatment Center.  It is a Blessing from God..........Keep Up the Great Work!!!,0x888a235420c115d5:0x1283ff33dd173aa1,Rapha Treatment Center,34.0061438,-86.09895639999999,Addiction treatment center,3.9,8,True,duplicate same biz (low review count); multi business same time (same category: Addiction treatment center)
